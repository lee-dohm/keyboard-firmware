# Lee Dohm's Keyboard Firmware

This is the keyboard firmware definition for my primary keyboard. This is currently an [Ergodox EZ Shine][ergodox] with Cherry MX Blue keyswitches. The firmware was built using the [Ergodox EZ Graphical Configurator][configurator].

## Layout

* Layer 0 &mdash; Dvorak layout with alterations for the Ergodox keyboard
* Layer 1 &mdash; Cursor navigation and function keys
* Layer 2 &mdash; Numeric keypad
* Layer 3 &mdash; Qwerty layout for when others need to use my keyboard or for playing video games that lack the ability to remap keys

See [the PDF][pdf] for details. Or [view on the configurator][my-layout] to base your own layout on mine.
